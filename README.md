# Algorithm Archive

This project is a personal project to build and catalog as many algorithms and data structures as possible in as many languages as I know.
This list will never be complete, whether it be a new language or another algorithm, but this is meant to be a help for those who need some reference.

## Objectives

- Write as much from scratch as possible
    - However if it makes the code much easier to read and we can assume we have already have built it then that's fine
- Optimize the code when possible but do not over-optimize it such that it is impossible to fluently read
- Even though there are many forms of each algorithm, only write the one best suited to that task
    - Recursive algorithms should have both recursive and non-recursive forms presented
    - Most algorithms just need to be runnable when scalable)
- Each algorithm will have a function on the algorithm, but no driver code
    - If a driver code is needed (I.E. specific implementation details) then it will be noted and provided
